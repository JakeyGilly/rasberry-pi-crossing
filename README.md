# Pedestrian Crossing
#### About
This Project is for PA's Raspberry Pi Competition where you create a project around a theme on a Rasberry Pi.
This years theme is set as Smart Citys and we are creating a smart pedestrian crossing to help the blind and improve the crossing experiance where we will notify people when they get near the crossing on a Android phone or watch with an android app or detect if someone is waiting to cross with facial recognition and starts to switch the traffic lights and switch to the green man and phone and watches are notified to cross. Once there is no more movement the traffic lights switch back.
#### How we will do it
We are going to use python and the module `face recogition` and `cv2` to help with facial recognition and `sockets` to help with notifing the user to cross. We will also use Android Studio with the programming language Kotlin to create the app.
